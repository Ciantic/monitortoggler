Monitor toggler 0.3.2

Usage: monitortoggler.exe <monitornumber> [<forceState>] [<apply>]

  Capable of attaching and deattaching monitors from command line.

  Note: Resolution / display settings should be configured from Windows dialog.
        At least in Windows 7 the changes are saved to registry, and next time
        you attach the same screen it retrieves same settings. Thus it seems
        to be useless to define them while attaching.

  monitornumber:
             Monitor number, this may, and usually differs from monitor numbers
             in the screen resolution dialog. So you have to try several numbers
             until you find the right one :)

  forceState (optional):
            -1 = Toggles. (Tries to get the current mode, and toggles.) (default)
             1 = Attach
             0 = Detach

  apply (optional):
             1 = Apply changes immediately (default)
             0 = Do not apply changes
                 You have to call second time to apply changes
